Proceedings will resume at the slightly earlier time of 9.30am at the Auckland High Court today before Justice Graham Lang and a jury of eight women and three men.

Yesterday, McClintock said all the various pieces of hard and circumstantial evidence, woven together and followed to their conclusion, led to the conclusi Hanna did not hang herself, as Polkinghorne claimed.

“The Crown says once you fit everything together here you can be sure that suicide can be excluded here,” McClintock said.

“This was murder.”

McClintock, in her opening address to the jury 49 days ago, said the staged suicide was the crescendo of a double life Polkinghorne had been leading where he used meth heavily and spent thousands upon thousands on sex workers.

She said the killing was presaged by domestic violence, as recounted by famy friends of Hanna’s who said she had told them her husband had placed his hands on her neck and told her he could do it again, any time.

Crown lays out case for Polkinghorne’s guilt

The two worlds of Dr Philip Polkinghorne – in one the renowned eye surgeon and loving husband of Pauline Hanna, and in the other a shadow life involving meth, aggression and fantasies of a new start with his well-compensated escort mistress – were about to collide.

The result, prosecutors said as they devoted an enre day to delivering a closing address in his murder trial, was both violent and tragic.

“Here we have a man spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on sex workers and drugs in secret and trying to keep his second life away from Pauline Hanna,” Crown solicitor Alysha McClintock told jurors. “Dr Polkinghore has become aggressively more and more shambolic ...

“He’s obsessed with [Sydney escort] Madison Ashton. He’s thinking he’s setting up a life with her ... He’s haemorrhaging money, anmoney’s something he’s preoccupied with.”

And all the while, it was alleged, his methamphetamine dependency was increasing, resulting in friends and coworkers sometimes noticing a change in his behaviour, and Hanna was starting to have suspicions.

“There’s a tinder box ready to go up,” McClintock said this afternoon, theorising that it culminated overnight on April 5, 2021, with either a surprise attack on his wife as she slept or an argument that turned fatally violent.

Polkinghorne, 71, is now in the eighth week of his high-profile trial in the High Court at Auckland, where the Crown has accused him of fatally strangling his wife before staging the scene at their Remuera home in an attempt to make it look ke a suicide. His lawyers, who are expected to give their own lengthy closing address either tomorrow or on Wednesday, have said it’s a clear case of suicide warped by police overreach and the Crown’s fascination with his sex life.

McClintock was unable to cram the entire Crown closing address into one day. She’s expected to finish this morning, at which point it will be decided if jurors are sent home for the day or if defence lawyer Ron Mansfield KC goes immediately into his closing addresPhilip Polkinghorne trial live updates: Crown to finish closing address before defence closes
